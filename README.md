# Crab Stun Timers
This plugin will display a timer over crabs in the Chambers of Xeric to show when they will become unstunned.

## Notice
Crabs in the Chambers of Xeric have a 10-tick window where they will unstun. This means that this plugin can't show 
exactly when the crabs will become unstunned. Instead, it will show one timer that displays the minimum amount of time, 
as well as a separate timer to show the 10-tick interval.
